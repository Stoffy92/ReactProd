# ReactProd

Mini Netflix

Netflix clone built using React.js.
Making use of React's powerful virtual DOM manipulation, a simple search function was implemented.

By typing in keyphrases or letters, tv shows are filtered, and desired results are shown almost instantly. Each tv show has it's own page showcasing a trailer.
